# Hello!

I'm a recent graduate of UC Davis in Computer Science, and I'm planning to use this blog to write about, mostly whatever I'm doing or learning about. Right now the primary audience is myself, but hopefully if anyone ends up reading this I've written something they find interesting or useful!
