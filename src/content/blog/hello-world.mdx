# Hello!

I'm a recent graduate of UC Davis in Computer Science, and I'm planning to use this blog to write about, mostly whatever I'm doing or learning about. Right now the primary audience is myself, but hopefully if anyone ends up reading this I've written something they find interesting or useful!

# What I'm Up To

The biggest thing on my plate recently is the job search, which has been interesting to say the least. 
I entered into CS about a year before the explosion of LLM tooling for programming. Though, I followed both SSC and Gwern with interest as they discussed the development of LMs, and arguably had all the information necessary to say "big improvements were likely", if not on timing.
That being said, it's quite exciting! And a little disconcerting. Applying for each job can certainly feel like putting a mite on a growing pile of slop.
Of course, there's also way more that can be built now! And that's on balance, very worthwhile, but it requires me to change the way I look at things. 
Hence this blog. Inspired by the ethos (still missing much of the conceptual and technical framework) of Gwern's site, I want to write more, so my tendency towards broad and diffuse learning is more productively channeled. Really learning how to build things seems to mostly come in the doing, and I'm excited about the doing!
