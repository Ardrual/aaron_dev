I don't really have a grand theory here, but as I've been working on developing an android app (without a ton of past experience with LLM development), I was reminded viscerally of how far capabilities came last December. It was obvious to me there was a huge jump at the time. But, as I was working with Android Studio and trying to fix a build error, the Gemini assistance just wasn't working well. Presumably, this is because the no-cost Gemini in Android Studio is still 2.5 Pro. Antigravity with Claude 4.5 Opus, on the other hand, solved the problem handily, despite having to interact with ADB over the command line to do it. 
Again, I can't say where this is going. But, my feeling (not a [rare one](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/heiliger-dankgesang)) that we've crossed another threshhold that suddenly feels "AGI-ish" was cemented by this relatively small change.
