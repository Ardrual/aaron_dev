As a musician, I've watched the development of models for music generation with a lot of interest (and a fair amount of trepidation as well). And, while the stuff they can do is undoubtedly impressive, I've been less struck than I have, by, say, AI writing and coding. Because, those aren't merely impressive apes of human work, but seem to me to show an impressive degree of reasoning, and fairly high level work.
This led to the question of how one might leverage all the reasoning ability and musical knowledge that is latent in a SOTA model for generating music! So, I (with a lot of assistance from AI, because I'm not particularly expert in PL theory), made a basic DSL with an eye towards describing music in a way that is "closer to thought" than other forms of text based music notation.
Lots exist, of course, but they're all trying to solve different problems. Music programming languages, like super collider, want to enable engaging with sound in a programmatic/algorithmic way. Engraving languages, like MusicXML, want to enable you to describe sheet music for mostly visual purposes. The closest is abc notation (and Gwern did some [similar experiments](https://gwern.net/gpt-2-music) back in the GPT-2 days), but it has several things that make it great for humans, but harder for LLMs.

I'm planning to release the compiler and a description of the language soon, but I've been amazed at the success, and the different behaviors the models have. Claude seems to have a real knack for it, and when given the challenge to compose a larger piece, composed a four movement piece with remarkable thematic and motivic coherence.
And this required no training, no substantial custom harnessing or anything like that. Just a small markdown guide and a prompt, and it went off. While the "sound quality" (being just midi) was inferior to models like Suno, I thought the musical coherence and interest and the ability to reflect on the piece was greater than most of what I see from that approach. And, it makes me wonder if this couldn't be a new paradigm for music generation models. We have great multimodal capacities in visual elements, and even in audio in some sense, but not musically. I don't know, this is highly speculative, but it seems to me that the conjunction of these two modes could allow for a compositional approach that is much more intelligent than we've seen til now.
